# A Lighthouse Style Guide: Editorial Content

Because when it comes to sales, content counts as much as code.

## 1. How to write well

Good writing removes any barriers between your reader and the message you're communicating. There is no single way to write well, but there are many tried-and-tested rules that will improve your writing.

- **Show, don't tell.** Explain yourself by giving concrete examples, not using abstractions. Don't tell people what to feel – show them the evidence that will make them feel it. Theresa May told the press that she was strong and stable. The evidence showed that she wasn't. Concrete beats abstract every time.
- **Simple sentences are better than complex sentences.** Sentences that string together several clauses can be confusing, ambiguous and ineffective. Simple sentences are clear, concise and strong. Varying the length of your sentences can keep readers interested, but most of your sentences should be short.
- **Put important information first.** You don't know how far through the content readers will go, so make sure the key points are at the start of the piece. 
- **Avoid overused terms and jargon.** The more a word is used, the less impact it has. Words like 'bespoke', 'unique' and 'disrupt' have been overused to the point that most readers will glaze over them. Other terms – 'facilitate', 'front-load', 'action' – are simply jargon versions of plain English words. Don't use them.
