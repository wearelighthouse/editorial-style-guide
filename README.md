# A Lighthouse Style Guide: Editorial Content

Because when it comes to sales, content counts as much as code.

## Style

### Numbers

Numbers up to ten should be written out as word ('one year', 'four children'). From 11 upwards they should be represented with numerals ('1,435 voters', '52 weeks'). _Exception: if you're using several numbers in the same context (a list or a range), pick either numerals or words and be consistent throughout: 'There were five pigs, seven horses and twelve sheep', 'The students were aged 8 to 50'._

Never start a sentence with a numeral ('12 people voted for Labour'). Capital letters are a key visual cue to indicate the beginning of a sentence, so starting a sentence with a numeral makes it more difficult for people to read. If a sentence starts with a numeral, rewrite it so the number isn't at the start ('Labour received 12 votes'). _Exception: it's acceptable to start a headline with a numeral._

### Dates

If written out in full, dates should be in the format __weekday (full word), day (numeric), month (word), year (full numeric)__: 'Tuesday 4 July 2017'. When omitting the weekday, day or year, keep the same order but omit the unnecessary elements: '10 August 2018', 'July 2015', '17 January'.

### Punctuation

#### Hyphens and en-dashes

These are different symbols: -, –. The first is a hyphen, and is slightly shorter. The longer mark is an en-dash (so-called because it has the same width as an 'n').

Hyphens are used to join words together ('sabre-toothed tiger', 'cutting-edge technology') or indicate that a word has broken across two lines. They should also be used to form a compound adjective ('it was a high-quality product').

En-dashes are are used to denote ranges ('1970–2017') or to introduce supplementary information in a sentence ('Three hours later – after a stiff drink and several cups of coffee – he was ready to leave the house'). 

Because en-dashes can be used in place of a range of other punctuation marks, they should be used with caution. The reader has to infer whether the dash has been used as a comma, a semicolon or a parenthesis, which shifts the effort from the writer to the reader. Do the thinking yourself, so the reader doesn't have to.

#### Semicolons

'Do not use semicolons. They are transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing. All they do is show you've been to college.' Kurt Vonnegut said that. He's right.

#### Quotation marks

Use straight quotation marks (', "), not curly quotation marks (‘, “). Initial quotations should use single quotes, while quotations-within-quotations should use double quotes. _Example: 'Punctuation might sound boring', said Steve, 'but "bad punctuation can ruin a pitch", as one expert said.'_

### Formatting

Italic and bold text should be used sparingly. This is particularly true online. Accessibility devices will often attribute semantic value to `<b>` and `<i>` tags, and research has shown that formatted text can be harder to read. _Exception: this sentence._

## How to write well

Good writing removes any barriers between your reader and the message you're communicating. There is no single way to write well, but there are many tried-and-tested rules that will improve your writing.

- **Show, don't tell.** Explain yourself by giving concrete examples, not using abstractions. Don't tell people what to feel – show them the evidence that will make them feel it. Theresa May told the press that she was strong and stable. The evidence showed that she wasn't. Concrete beats abstract every time.
- **Simple sentences are better than complex sentences.** Sentences that string together several clauses can be confusing, ambiguous and ineffective. Simple sentences are clear, concise and strong. Varying the length of your sentences can keep readers interested, but most of your sentences should be short.
- **Put important information first.** You don't know how far through the content readers will go, so make sure the key points are at the start of the piece.
- **Avoid overused terms and jargon.** The more a word is used, the less impact it has. Words like 'bespoke', 'unique' and 'disrupt' have been overused to the point that most readers will glaze over them. Other terms – 'facilitate', 'front-load', 'action' as a verb – are simply jargon versions of plain English words. Don't use them.
- **Don't overuse adjectives.** Adjectives may seem
